# tensorflow-ue4

Currently incomplete, needs to encapsulate scripts in the plugin and add tensorflow module ready release with both dependency plugins. See https://github.com/getnamo/tensorflow-ue4/issues for details. 

Depends on https://github.com/getnamo/UnrealEnginePython fork and https://github.com/getnamo/socketio-client-ue4

Example project https://github.com/getnamo/tensorflow-ue4-mnist-example. Under development to test full python + tensorflow encapsulation for drag and drop installation.
